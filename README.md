# DETranet
A group of inspired college students decided to make an application for bank employees and decided to call it DETranet. The ERP module will help the employees edit, save, learn, delete or share data regarding their profession. This project was created for the course "Java II" of the Department of Management Science and Technology (Athens University of Economics and Business) which was taught by Diomidis Spinellis.

## Description 
The application will be used only by the employees of the bank (customers will not have access).
After having taken inside information from a greek bank we made classes for each employee and for the two basic type of customers: Business and Private.
Apart from the code that appears to the command line, we decided to make a database and enhance our code with graphical user interface.

## Tools
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) 
* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) - For testing java code
* [MySQL 5](https://www.mysql.com/) - For saving and recalling data
* [JDBC](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) - Tool for connecting mySQL database with java code
* [Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html) - Documentation Generator
* [CheckStyle](https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/#!/) - Eclipse plugin 
* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - GUI 
* [Scene Builder](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) - GUI
* [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io) - library used for the realization of GUI


## How to use the application 

#### Black Screen
If you want to run the application in black screen, without GUI, it is required the installation of [mySQL connector/j](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) (any version). Inside the [src file](https://github.com/VasilikiKaragianni/DETranet/tree/master/src) you will find the classes that you need to download at your computer to run the program.

#### GUI
If you desire to see the graphical user interface there are two options.
You can either use the code that exists in the [FinalProgramwithGui file](https://github.com/VasilikiKaragianni/DETranet/tree/master/FinalProgramwithGui) and run it at your computer, or you can download our application directly as a .jar file. ([Click here](https://github.com/VasilikiKaragianni/DETranet/blob/master/DETranet.jar/DETranet.jar))

#### Manual 
Inside the repository you can also find the [manual](https://github.com/VasilikiKaragianni/DETranet/blob/master/DETranetÎœanual%20.pdf) with instructions regarding the application.
